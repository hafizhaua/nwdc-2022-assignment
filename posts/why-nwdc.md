Joining NWDC has been my one of my personal target in DTETI UGM. Here's what motivates me:

> # Learning Experiences
>
> it's undenied that there's still a lot of stuffs to learn for me. I think NWDC is a perfect place to **boost up my knowledge** about in web development.

> # Communities

> I'm such of that _**kupu-kupu**_ stud, tho. No wonder I haven't joined any technical community yet ðŸ˜¥. Joining NWDC means getting ready to be surrounded by many **insightful** and **passionate** people. **Discussions** and **talks** with 'em will open up new knowledges!

> # Collaboration Opportunities

> I've been in the third semester and I think I'm not doing that much technical experiences. While I'm interested in making some **collaboration** projects with friends, especially in **competitions**, I hope NWDC is a perfect place to get going.

I hope that by joining NWDC, I can improve myself more. I also really hope to find someone to be a place for me to ask and learn more! Collaboration and cooperation opportunities is also what I hope I can get. But most importantly, I hope joining NWDC this year will be fun for me and for others.
